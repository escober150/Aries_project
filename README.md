PDF Answering Bot
Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for developing a Question and Answer (Q&A) bot using the Llama model. The bot is designed to process and comprehend large volumes of text from PDF documents and generate relevant answers to user queries. The project leverages the Langchain framework for document retrieval and FAISS for efficient embedding generation.

Introduction
Problem Statement
The project aims to develop an automated system that can provide accurate and efficient responses to user queries by understanding and processing large volumes of text from PDF documents.

Objectives
Develop a Q&A bot using the Llama model.
Integrate the bot with document retrieval and embedding generation frameworks.
Evaluate the bot's performance using standard metrics.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-answering-bot.git
cd pdf-answering-bot
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the HuggingFace API token:

bash
Copy code
export HuggingFaceHub_API_Token=your_api_token
Usage
Load Documents:
Place your PDF documents in the directory and ensure they are processed into text format, loaded through the input.txt file. The loader will read this file to process the documents.

Run the Notebook:
Open and run the Jupyter notebook pdf_answering_bot.ipynb. This will execute all the steps to create and evaluate the Q&A bot.

Ask Questions:
Use the setup Q&A chain to ask questions and receive answers based on the provided documents.

Approach
Methodology
Environment Setup: Install necessary libraries and set up the environment.
Configuration: Set API tokens and model configurations.
Data Loading: Load documents using TextLoader.
Text Splitting: Split documents into chunks using CharacterTextSplitter.
Embeddings Generation: Generate embeddings using HuggingFaceEmbeddings.
Vector Store Creation: Create a vector store with FAISS.
Model Initialization: Load the Llama model and tokenizer.
Question-Answer Chain Setup: Establish a question-answering chain.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluate performance using ROUGE scores.
Detailed Steps
The detailed code implementation for each step is provided in the Jupyter notebook.

Failed Approaches
Initial Model Configurations
Issue: Loss of context and inaccurate answers.
Solution: Adjusted text splitting parameters.
Embedding Model Selection
Issue: Poor retrieval accuracy.
Solution: Switched to intfloat/e5-large-v2 model.
Results
Performance Metrics
The performance of the Q&A bot is evaluated using ROUGE scores, which measure the overlap between generated answers and ground truth answers. Detailed metrics and visualizations are provided in the notebook.

Graphs and Visualizations
Graphs showing the ROUGE scores and other relevant visualizations can be found in the results section of the notebook.

Discussion
Analysis of Results
Improvements in text splitting and embedding generation significantly enhanced the bot's performance.
Efficient retrieval capabilities of the FAISS vector store were crucial for the bot's responsiveness.
Insights Gained
Proper text splitting and context preservation are vital.
High-quality embeddings directly impact the relevance of answers.
Continuous evaluation and fine-tuning are necessary.
Conclusion
Summary of Findings
The Q&A bot using the Llama model demonstrated good performance in generating relevant answers.
Key improvements in text splitting, embedding quality, and vector store efficiency were crucial to the success.
Future Improvements
Further fine-tuning of the Llama model.
Exploring advanced embedding techniques.
Implementing the bot in a real-time environment.
